  "HomeUi.WhatIs": "JSON, an acronym for \"JavaScript Object Notation,\" is a lightweight data interchange format. Created to facilitate data transmission between a server and a web client, JSON has become a common standard for the structured representation of information. Its simplicity and human-readable nature make it widely used in web application development and system communication. Data in JSON format is organized into key-value pairs and nested structures, providing an effective way to represent complex information in an easily understandable format.
